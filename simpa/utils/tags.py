    This class contains all 'Tags' for the use in the settings dictionary as well as strings that are used in SIMPA

    Every Tag that is intended to be used as a key in the settings dictionary is represented by a tuple.
    The first element of the tuple is a string that corresponds to the name of the Tag.
    The second element of the tuple is a data type or a tuple of data types.
    The values that are assigned to the keys in the settings should match these data types.
