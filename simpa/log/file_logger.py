    The SIMPA Logger.
    The purpose of this class is to guarantee that the logging Config has been set and that logging strings are written
    to the same file throughout the entire simulation pipeline.
    Per default, the log file is located in the home directory as defined by Path.home().

    The log levels are defined the same way they are in the python logging module:
    DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
    INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
    WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future
    (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.
    ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
    CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.
