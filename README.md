The Simulation and Image Processing for Photoacoustic Imaging (SIMPA) toolkit.

## Internal Install Instructions

These install instructions are made under the assumption that you have access to the phabricator simpa project.
When you are reading these instructions there is a 99% chance that is the case (or someone send these instructions
to you).

So, for the 1% of you: Please also follow steps 1 - 3:

1. `git clone https://phabricator.mitk.org/source/simpa.git`
2. `git checkout master`
3. `git pull`

Now open a python instance in the 'simpa' folder that you have just downloaded. Make sure that you have your preferred
virtual environment activated
4. `cd simpa`
5. `python -m setup.py build install`
6. Test if the installation worked by using `python` followed by `import simpa` then `exit()`

If no error messages arise, you are now setup to use simpa in your project.

## Building the documentation

When the installation went fine and you want to make sure that you have the latest documentation
you should do the following steps in a command line:

1. Navigate to the `simpa` source directory (same level where the setup.py is in)
2. Execute the command `sphinx-build -b pdf -a documentation/src documentation`
3. Find the `PDF` file in `documentation/simpa_documantation.pdf`

## Overview

The main use case for the simpa framework is the simulation of photoacoustic images.
However, it can also be used for image processing.

### Simulating photoacoustic images

A basic example on how to use simpa in you project to run an optical forward simulation is given in the 
samples/minimal_optical_simulation.py file.

## Performance profiling

Do you wish to know which parts of the simulation pipeline cost the most amount of time? 
If that is the case then you can use the following commands to profile the execution of your simulation script.
You simply need to replace the `myscript` name with your script name.

`python -m cProfile -o myscript.cprof myscript.py`

`pyprof2calltree -k -i myscript.cprof`
