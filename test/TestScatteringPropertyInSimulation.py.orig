"""
This Script uses the Lambert-Beer law to test mcx or mcxyz for the correct
attenuation of a photon beam passing through a thin absorbing and/or scattering
slab.

All tests test a scenario, where a pencil source in z-dir in the middle 
of the xy-plane emits photons in a 27x27x100 medium.
In the middle of the medium is an absorbing and/or scattering slab of 1 pixel in the xy-plane and some distance in z-dir.
In all tests, the fluence in the middle of the xy-plane and in z-dir the pixels 10 and 90 is measured.
So basically, the fluence after passing the slab with total attenuation (mua+mus) is measured.
For instance, we expect, that the fluence decreases by a factor of e^-1 if mua+mus=0.1 mm^-1 and the slab is 10mm long.

Usage of this script:
The script has to be in the same folder as the mcx executable binary.
If this is met, the script can just be run.

Use the test functions to test the specific cases that are explained in the respective tests.
Please read the description of every test and run them one after the other.
Be aware that by running multiple tests at once, the previous tests are overwritten.
