# Developer Guide

Dear SIMPA developers.
This Guide is meant to be used as a collection of How-To's to contribute to the framework.

## Coding style

When writing code for SIMPA, please consider to use the following structures in your code in order to make a new
developer or someone external always know exactly what to expect.

- Classnames are written in camel-case notation `ClassName`
- Function names are written in small letter with `_` as the delimiter `function_name`
- Function parameters are always annotated with their type `arg1: type = default`
- Only use primitive types as defaults. If a non-primitive type is used, then the default should be `None` and
 the parameter should be initialized in the beginning of a function.
- A single line of code should not be longer than 120 characters.
- Functions should follow the following simple structure:
  1. Input validation (arguments all not `None`, correct type, and acceptable value ranges?)
  2. Processing (clean handling of errors that might occur)
  3. Output generation (sanity checking of the output before handing it off to the caller)

## Documenting your code
Only documented code will appear in the sphinx generated documentation.

A class should be documented using the following syntax:


    class ClassName(Superclass):
        """
        Explain how the class is used and what it does.
        """

For functions, a lot of extra attributes can be added to the documentation:


    def function_name(self, arg1:type = default, arg2:type = default) -> return_type:
        """
        Explain how the function is used and what it does.
        
        :param arg1: type, value range, Null acceptable?
        :param arg2: type, value range, Null acceptable?
        :returns: type, value range, does it return Null?
        :raises ExceptionType: explain when and why this exception is raised
        """

## Adding literature absorption spectra

 The central point, where absorption spectra are collected and handled is in 
 `simpa.utils.libraries.spectra_library.py`. The file comprises the class `AbsorptionSpectrumLibrary`, in which the
 new absorption spectra can be added using the following two steps:
 
 1. In the beginning of the class, there is a bunch of constants that define spectra using the `AbsorptionSpectrum`
 class. Add a new constant here: `NEW_SPECTRUM = AbsorptionSpectrum(absorber_name, wavelengths, absorptions)`. By
 convention, the naming of the constant should be the same as the `absorber_name` field. The `wavelengths` and
 `absorptions` arrays must be of the same length and contain corresponding values.
 
 2. In the `__init__` method of the `AbsorptionSpectrumLibrary` class, the class constants are added to an internal
 list. This has the benefit of enabling the Library class to be iterable. Add your newly added constant field to 
 the list here.
 
 3. Your absorption spectrum is now usable throughout all of simpa and is accessible using the `SPECTRAL_LIBRARY`
 sngleton that can be imported using `from simpa.utils import SPECTRAL_LIBRARY`.
